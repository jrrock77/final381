This is one of the first files I updated created new in this section

The front matter is the content between the triple dashes and has a specific format that jekyll is looking for.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
# to get the images to disply here I had to add /webtheme to the path
# this top code displays the bio-photo shadow image
![caption](/webtheme/assets/images/bio-photo.jpg)
# this standard path code shows a broken image
![caption](/assets/images/bio-photo.jpg)
# so does this pathing even though autocomplete works with the pathing below!
![caption](../assets/images/bio-photo.jpg)
```
![image-center](/webtheme/assets/images/COLOURBOX16037408.jpg){: .align-center}
![working_path](/webtheme/assets/images/bio-photo.jpg)
![broken_path](/assets/images/bio-photo.jpg)
![broken_path](../assets/images/bio-photo.jpg)
