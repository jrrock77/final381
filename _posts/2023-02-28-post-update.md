This is one of the first files I updated created new in this section

The front matter is the content between the triple dashes and has a specific format that jekyll is looking for.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
