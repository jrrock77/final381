### Basics of Bobsled

There are 16 bobsled tracks around the world. Each is made from concrete, covered in frozen water that changes drastcily depending on the weather conditions. The colder and harder the ice, the faster the sleds can fly down the track.

Each racer needs a bobsled, which is made to be as light and areodynamic as possible. Sleds can reach speens of over 135 km/hr and riders feel forces greater that 5G's. The sleds handle using the front metal tracks to help guide the sled around the track. Similar to ice skates, they are meant to reduce friction to allow maximum top speed. 

Riders have two ways to make the sleds go faster. The first is at the start of the race, where they push the sled into the first downhill section. This is the only time they are able to directly apply force and increase speed. The other way is by makes good turns and carrying speed through each corner. The racers can steer, and shift their weight within the sled to help cornering and keep the speed high. 

Races are decided by fractions of a second, so getting everything right is key to success.
