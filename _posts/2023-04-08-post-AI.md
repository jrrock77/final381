title: "AI Predicted Bobsled Run Velocities"
---

Artificial Intelligence was asked to predict bobsled velocity at the Winsport Track here in Calgary, AB

The following graph displays the velocity of a bobsled going down the Winsport track with half-second intervals. It also uses a python code to display acceleration data of the sample velocity.

The Python File linked above shows the processing done to turn the AI prediciton into the image, including the process for converting the velocity data to acceleration data. Inside the file, the AI output is read out.
