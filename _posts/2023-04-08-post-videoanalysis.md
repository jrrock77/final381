This [video](https://github.com/jrrock77/knes381/blob/main/Bobsled%20Start%20Comparison.mp4) is a comparison of two individual bobsled starts. 
Please download the video to view as it is to large for github to present. 

These three photos show three significant differences between the two starts.

This image shows how each athlete sets up to push. The graphic analysis shows the hip poition relative to the sled. The athlete on the left gets their hips lower, more in line with the sled. On the otherhand, the athlete on the right keeps their hips high, which may require compensation to get their weight directly behind the sled

This image shows the difference between the athletes as the sled begins to move. The athlete on the left has their hips closed and ready to explode forward, with their bodyweight still floating forward. The athlete on the right has a higher hip angle, with less forward lean, which will result in less hip involvment in the begninning of the movement.

This image shows the difference between the two athletes' first steps. The athlete on the left has a longer hip extension, resulting in a later first step with more forward momentum. The athlete on the right has completed their hip move quicker, and is relying on a first step earlier to continue accelerating. 
Because the time doesn't start until a certain point down the track, there is no use in rushing the takeoff like the athlete on the right.
